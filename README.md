## Supporting Documentation

Besides a `README.md`, your repo should contain a `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing major code changes, a `LICENSE.md` describing the code's license (typically Apache 2.0 for our open-source projects, All Rights Reserved for internal projects), and a `notes/` directory that is a git submodule of the project's wiki. See the [style guide for repo organization](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/style_guide/blob/master/style-guide-for-repo-organization.md) for more details.
